# In this section we're going over __new__ function

# Whenever a new object of a class is instantiated __new__ and __init__ methods are called.
# __new__ method will be called when an object is created and __init__ method will be called to initialize the object.
# So in a nutshell:
# __new__ -> for creating object
# __init__ -> for initialize object (setting values)
